        "description": "I developed the Brighture Innovation company website as a solo project to demonstrate my full-cycle front-end development skills using modern React practices. The entire frontend was built from scratch using React.js, with a focus on reusability, performance, and scalability. I implemented modular and reusable components, enabling clean and efficient routing with React Router. The user interface was enhanced using Framer Motion to provide smooth animations and transitions, delivering a polished and interactive user experience. I designed fully responsive layouts using CSS and Bootstrap to ensure compatibility across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. To improve discoverability and load performance, I applied SEO best practices including semantic HTML, meta tags, and optimization techniques. The website includes dedicated sections for Home, Services, Blog, Careers, Portfolio, and Contact, each carefully designed for usability and clarity. I also integrated animated image overlays and scroll-based visual effects to enrich user interaction. Cross-browser testing was conducted to validate consistent functionality and design on all major platforms. This project reflects my ability to independently create a professional, responsive, and SEO-optimized web application using React.js and modern front-end technologies.",
